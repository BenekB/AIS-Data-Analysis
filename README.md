# AIS Data Analysis

This program was written as a part of the research project. I was checking if there is a dependence between the AIS system signal range and actual season. 

First, the raw AIS data, which was collected earlier, needed to be decoded to human-understandable format. Then the extracted information was analysed and sorted, focusing on the distance between transmitter and receiver.

A clearly conclusion was made, that the AIS system signal range reached higher values during summer than winter.
